# Dovetail

**An opinionated CLI that scaffolds and automates the entire PERN stack development workflow.**

## What It Does

Dovetail generates production-ready full-stack applications (React + Express + PostgreSQL + Node) with all infrastructure pre-configured and wired together: Supabase for database/auth, Fly.io for deployment, GitHub for code/CI, and Linear for issue tracking.

More importantly, it **enforces your development workflow** through a CLI that handles commits, testing, issue tracking, PR management, and deployments—so you never forget a step.

## The Problem

Starting a new full-stack project means:
- 2-3 days configuring infrastructure (database, auth, hosting, CI/CD)
- Manual workflow steps that get forgotten (commit conventions, updating tickets, running tests, updating docs)
- Inconsistent processes across projects and team members
- Context-switching between tools (GitHub, Linear, Supabase dashboards)

## How It Works

**One command scaffolds everything:**
```bash
dovetail init "My Project"
```
Generates a working app in 5 minutes with auth flow, database, deployments, and CI/CD configured.

**CLI commands enforce workflow:**
```bash
dovetail start        # Pick Linear issue, create branch
dovetail commit       # Auto-test, format, push, update Linear
dovetail merge        # Run quality checks, merge to main
dovetail deploy staging    # One-command deployment
```

Every action is deterministic—runs security scans, visual tests, updates tickets, manages PRs automatically. No steps get skipped.

## Installation

### From npm (Coming Soon)

```bash
npm install -g @lumberjack-so/dovetail
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lumberjack-so/dovetail.git
cd dovetail
npm install
npm link
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Run Onboarding (First Time)

```bash
dovetail onboard
```

This interactive wizard will:
- 📚 **Assess your skill level** - Quick quiz to tailor the experience
- 🔑 **Configure API tokens** - GitHub, Linear, Supabase, Fly.io with connection testing
- 🚀 **Choose your path** - New project, existing repo, or current folder

### 2. Create a New Project

```bash
dovetail init "My Awesome App"
```

This will:
- ✅ Scaffold a PERN stack project
- ✅ Create GitHub repository
- ✅ Create Linear project with starter issues
- ✅ Create Supabase project
- ✅ Create Fly.io apps (staging + production)
- ✅ Initialize git and push

### 3. Start Developing

```bash
cd my-awesome-app
npm run dev              # Start dev servers
dovetail start           # Begin working on an issue
```

### Manual Token Configuration

If you skip onboarding or need to update tokens later:

```bash
dovetail config
```

You'll need:
- **GitHub Token**: [Create here](https://github.com/settings/tokens) (scopes: `repo`, `workflow`)
- **Linear API Key**: [Create here](https://linear.app/settings/api)
- **Supabase Token**: [Create here](https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens)
- **Fly.io Token**: Run `flyctl auth token`

## Commands

### Getting Started

```bash
dovetail onboard                # Interactive onboarding wizard (first time)
dovetail config                 # Manage API tokens (anytime)
```

### Project Lifecycle

```bash
dovetail init "Project Name"    # Bootstrap new project
dovetail status                 # Show current project state
```

### Work Session

```bash
dovetail start                  # Query Linear, pick issue, create branch
dovetail start <issue-key>      # Start work on specific issue (e.g., TS-007)
```

### During Work

```bash
dovetail commit                 # Smart commit (auto-detects changes, runs checks)
dovetail test                   # Run relevant tests based on changed files
dovetail check                  # Run quality checks without committing
```

### Finishing Work

```bash
dovetail ready                  # Run quality gate, check if ready to merge
dovetail merge                  # Merge to main (runs quality gate first)
```

### Deployment

```bash
dovetail deploy staging         # Deploy to staging
dovetail deploy production      # Deploy to production
dovetail rollback <env> <ver>   # Rollback deployment
```

### Utilities

```bash
dovetail sync                   # Sync main branch
dovetail clean                  # Clean up merged branches
dovetail migrate                # Run/manage database migrations
```

## Workflow Example

```bash
# Start work
dovetail start
# → Queries Linear for open issues
# → Creates branch: feat/TS-007-add-user-profile

# Make changes...
vim apps/web/src/components/Profile.tsx

# Commit with auto-checks
dovetail commit
# → Runs security scan ✅
# → Runs visual tests ✅
# → Creates PR (draft)
# → Updates Linear issue

# Check if ready to merge
dovetail ready
# → CI passing ✅
# → Tests passing ✅
# → No console.logs ✅
# → Documentation updated ✅

# Merge to main
dovetail merge
# → Squash merges PR
# → Closes Linear issue
# → Deletes feature branch

# Deploy
dovetail deploy staging
# → Deploys to Fly.io
# → Runs smoke tests ✅
```

## What Makes It Different

### ✅ Opinionated & Complete
Not a boilerplate—a complete development environment with enforced workflow.

### ✅ Infrastructure as Code
No manual clicking in dashboards. Everything created programmatically.

### ✅ Automated Quality Gates
Security scans, visual tests, doc checks run automatically. Can't merge broken code.

### ✅ Service Integration
GitHub, Linear, Supabase, and Fly.io work together seamlessly.

### ✅ CLI-First Design
Can be used standalone, by Claude Code, in hooks, or in CI/CD.
